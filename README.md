jaguarDb
================
The simplest database in JavaScript that could possible work. 

This library provides the ability to store information in a Node.js application
emulating a simple document-oriented database and without requiring an external 
process to be running.

The goal is to provide a quick and dirty way of storing information for small 
prototypes and unit testing. Do not use this to power your web site or the 
next eBay.

The API mimics MongoDBâ€™s API to allow for easy migration of applications using 
jaguarDb to a real database. Also, the fact the MongoDB has a kickass API makes 
it an great model to follow.

This database does not support transactions or any of the ACID properties. In 
fact you should not even consider it a database. 

The API is asynchronous so that the code using it can easily migrated to use a 
real database. I might provide a synchronous API later on to make its use much 
simpler, particularly for unit tests or batch processes.


Samples
------------
Adding data to brand new database (demoAdd.js.) 

    var jaguarDb = require('./jaguarDb').jaguarDb;
    var db = new jaguarDb();
    db.connect('./data', function(err) {
      if(err) {
        // handle error
        return;
      }
      var data = {title: 'hello', content: 'blah blah blah'};
      db.insert(data, function(err, insertedData) {
        // record inserted if err is null
      });
    });


Query data from the database (demoFind.js)

    var jaguarDb = require('./jaguarDb').jaguarDb;
    var db = new jaguarDb();
    db.connect('./data', function(err) {
      if(err) {
        // handle error
        return;
      }
      var query = {}; // all records
      var fields = {}; // all fields
      db.find(query, fields, function(err, documents) {
        // your data is in the documents array
      });
    });


Storage
-------
Data is stored in one per database. A master file "index.json" contains the list of 
documents in the database plus other general information about the database. One 
"n.json" file is created for each document.


Future enhancements
-------------------
Add support for complex queries. Currently only exact match queries are allowed.

    // This is currently supported
    // filter where fieldA == 'a' and fieldB == 'b'
    var query = {fieldA: 'a', fieldB: 'b'};

    // This is NOT currently supported
    // filter where fieldA == 'a' or fieldB == 'b'
    // filter where fieldA > 'a'


Add support for "indexes". Fields indexed will be kept in index.json file so 
that we don't have to reach out for the individual file for each record when 
searching indexed fields.  


Questions, comments, thoughts?

This is a very rough work in progress. Feel free to contact me with
